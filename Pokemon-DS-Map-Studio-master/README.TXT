POKEMON DS MAP STUDIO 2.2
=========================

Pokemon DS Map Studio is a tool for creating NDS Pok√©mon maps, designed to be used alongside SDSME or DSPRE.

It doesn't require 3D modeling knowledge. Rather, it provides a tilemap-like interface that is automatically converted to a 3D model. 
Please note that this tool DOES NOT allow modification of maps from official games.
